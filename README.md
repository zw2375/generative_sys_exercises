# My p5.js Art Project

This is a basic p5.js project to help you get started with creative coding!

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. You should see a canvas with interactive elements
3. Move your mouse around to see the effects!

## What's in the Code?
The current sketch demonstrates several basic p5.js concepts:
- `setup()`: Runs once at the start
- `draw()`: Runs continuously
- Basic shapes: circles and rectangles
- Color manipulation
- Mouse interaction
- Text rendering

## Learning Resources
- [p5.js Official Website](https://p5js.org/)
- [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
- [p5.js Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)
- [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) - Great video tutorials

## Next Steps
Try modifying the code to:
1. Change colors
2. Add more shapes
3. Experiment with different p5.js functions
4. Create your own interactive art!

## Tips for Artists
- Think of the canvas as your digital canvas
- Use `setup()` to set up your initial composition
- Use `draw()` to create animations and interactions
- Experiment with different shapes, colors, and effects
- Don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn!
